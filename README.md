## 📖 Overview

**EPOQ** brings the power of deep learning to your desktop. Built with **Tauri**, **Next.js**, and **PyTorch**, this application provides a sleek, intuitive GUI for training state-of-the-art image classification models locally. Say goodbye to complex CLI scripts and hello to real-time visual feedback!

## ✨ Features

- 🗂️ **Smart Dataset Management**: Easily select folders with `train`/`val` structures, or let the app auto-split flat folders. Export your prepared dataset to a ZIP file with one click.
- ⚙️ **Flexible Model Configuration**: Choose from modern architectures including **ResNet18**, **DCN**, and **EVA02**. Customize training epochs and batch sizes to suit your hardware.
- 📈 **Real-Time Analytics**: Monitor the training process with live PyTorch logs and dynamic, interactive **Loss and Accuracy Charts** (powered by Recharts).
- 📊 **Comprehensive Results**: After training completes, dive into detailed metrics with a full **Classification Report** and a visual **Confusion Matrix**.
- 🚀 **Native Performance**: Engineered with Rust and Tauri for a lightweight desktop footprint, paired with a blazing-fast Next.js frontend.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Lucide Icons, Recharts
- **Backend/Desktop Platform**: Tauri, Rust
- **Machine Learning**: Python, PyTorch, Torchvision, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🚀 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

1. **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** (v18+)
2. **[Rust](https://rustup.rs/)** (Required for Tauri builds)
3. **[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)** (3.9+)
4. **Machine Learning Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```

---

## 💻 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/epoq.git
   cd epoq
   ```

2. **Install Node dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run tauri dev
   ```
   _This command will compile the Rust backend, start the Next.js frontend, and launch the desktop window._

## 📦 Building for Production

To create an optimized, standalone executable for your operating system:

```bash
npm run tauri build
```

Once the build is complete, you can find the executable in `src-tauri/target/release/`.

---

## 🧩 Architecture

The application marries web technologies with native system capabilities:

1. **Next.js Frontend**: Provides a highly responsive, modern UI styled with Tailwind CSS.
2. **Tauri Core**: Written in Rust, it acts as the bridge, managing system menus, dialogs, and native operations.
3. **Python Worker Runtime**: Tauri spawns a Python subprocess (`python_backend/script.py`) to execute PyTorch training scripts securely and stream the stdout/stderr back to the UI for live tracking.
